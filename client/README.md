Nimbus is a weather application designed with accessibility in mind. What is accessibility? When a site is said to be accessible, it means that its content is available, and its functionality can be operated, by anyone, regardless of impairments of disabilities.   Not only does Nimbus display the current, hourly and daily weather for any city, but it also allows users to select their preffered units of temperature and switch between 5 languages (English, Spanish, French, Vietnamese, and Chinese). Our color scheme and minimal design was implemented to accomodate those with color blindness and cognitive conditions like ADD, Dyslexia, Autism.

## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->
Our passion for plants inspired us to create an app that enables fellow plant lovers to upload and share images and information about their plants. In this application users are able to create a collection of their plants and make posts. Plantr users can also view, like, and comment on posts belonging to other users. Our goal with this app is to create a space where new and existing plant parents can interact and share their love for all things plants.

Why an app such as this can be helpful:
* Provides accurate forecasts to enable users to make informed decisions.
* Accessibility features ensure that all potential users, including people with disabilities, have a decent user experience and are able to easily access information.
